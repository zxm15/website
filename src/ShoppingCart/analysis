What methods can we use?
1. cookie
2. session
3. database
4. session + database

cookie pros and cons
pros: easy; loading fast as it is stored on client side;
cons: client can change the shopping cart information; cannot serve client if they disable the cookie; once cookie is cleared, the information lost

session pros and cons
pros: safe as it is stored on the server side; easy to implement;
cons: could lost as it is stored in memory; sticky session over a distributed application;

database pros and cons
pros: safe; persistent record; easy to implemented; shared data storage could solve the distributed system problem
cons: slow;

session + database
combine the pros of session and database. We come up a solution with two steps.
1. Write log;
2. Write the updates of the shopping cart to session;
3. batch log updates to database.

pros: fast, persistent records;
cons: still have sticky session problem
